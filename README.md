# FYPGalileo

This repo houses the Perhipheral Sensor System for my Final Year Project developed while studying at the Unviersity College of Cork. The system is designed to run on an Intel Galileo, with the Grove Internet of Things(IoT) Sesnor Kit. This kit contains a base sheild and plug'n'play sensor modules. The system was developed using the UPM sensor library.
